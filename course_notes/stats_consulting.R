#DEBUGGING
#add view at the end of each line when dealing with a messy dataset, move it along as you go 
#only save it as the thing after the data is checked / good to go 

# SEND TO COLLEAGUES
# save buggy version of the dataset, only supply needed code
# sessionInfo() at top of script 
# codebook = metadata

#SEND TO STRANGERS / Stack overflow / Stack exchange
#send minimum reproducible dataset ("reprex") - there is also a reprex package in R
# OR messy up your own data / blurr some responses with same structure 
#look up dput - way to reproduce your data frame - dput(yourdataframe)
# the act of making this might helo you solve the problem!
